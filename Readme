# Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game implemented using Python's `
turtle` graphics module. The game involves controlling a snake that grows 
in size each time it eats food. The player scores points as the snake eats more food, 
but the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall. The game also keeps 
track of the highest score.


## Features
1. **Game Screen**:
    - Dimensions: 600x600 pixels
    - Background Color: White

2. **Snake**:
    - Moves with the arrow keys: **Up, Down, Left, Right**
    - Grows in length when it eats food

3. **Food**:
    - Randomly spawns on the screen
    - Consumed by the snake for points

4. **Scoreboard**:
    - Displays the current score and highest score
    - Persistent high-score storage in `data.txt`

5. **Game Over Conditions**:
    - When the snake collides with the wall
    - When the snake collides with itself

## File Structure
- **`main.py`**: The main file where the game loop is managed. Initializes the screen, snake, food, and scoreboard.
- **`snake.py`**: Contains the Snake class, handling the movement, growth, and collisions.
- **`food.py`**: Contains the Food class for spawning food randomly on the screen.
- **`scoreboard.py`**: Manages the scoring system, including the high score.
- **`data.txt`**: Stores the high score, which is loaded and saved between games.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required (only uses Python's built-in `turtle` module).
